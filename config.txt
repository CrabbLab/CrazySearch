//:			this is a comment
//:			do not change the string before colon :
//:			you can customise integer values after :   but these have to be integer values

//:			result is auto saved in the result fold in the format of 
//:			autosave_XXXX_year-month-day_hour-minute-second.csv

//:			To pause the test, press 'SPACE' key on the keyboard
//:			To resume the test, press 'ENTER' key on the keyboard

//:			Please make sure you use 100% zoom. Do not change the scale, because it affects the eccentricity calculation.

//:			[param]
//:			test can have 3 modes: complete random "cr", or fix random "fr"
test mode: 		cr

//:			[param]
//:			when test mode = fix random "fr", test can have different series (n>=0).
//:			Each serial (eg series = 1) has same stimuli but they are presented in different orders.
//:			So that you can compare results between different participants.
//:			If you want to compare performance within participants, you can compare results when series = 1, 2, 3 etc.. or simply use "complete random" mode.
test series: 		1


//:			[param]
//:			number of rows or columns in a screen
//:			have to be odd rows and odd columns, because centre image is reference stimulus
number of rows: 	7
number of columns:	9


//:			[param]
//: 			change the screen resolution according to your screen specifications
screen width:		2736
screen height:		1824



//:			[param]
//:			Screen dot pitch, ie: distance between two adjacent points on the physical screen
//:			This is used to calculate 'eccentricity'.
//:			unit is mm
dot pitch:		0.28

//:			[param]
//:			participant distance to the physical screen
//:			This is used to calculate 'eccentricity'.
//:			unit is mm
viewing distance:	500



//:			[param]
//:			display cursor? if yes, then you can simulate/test the test on a non-touch-monitor
display cursor:		No



//:			[param]
//: 			locations and repeated number for the location.
//:			If a location is not explicitely specified, it uses default value, which is 1.
//:			Total number of locations  = 'number of rows' x 'number of columns'
//:			centre location is where the reference stim locates.
//:			location starts from 0. it is the topleft stimulus on the screen.

//:			you can delete the individual location rows
//:			you can also explicitly set an individual location to 0 or someother number

//:			If you prefer to use row number and column number for locations, you can 
//:			convert them, simply use 
//:				row number = location/number of columns; (the integer part)
//:				col number = location - row number * number of columns;

 
//:			So it will not be tested even you explicitely set a value for it
